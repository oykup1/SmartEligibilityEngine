# SmartEligibilityEngine
A Java-based Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) model to represent course prerequisites for any academic major to assist on structuring upcoming semesters based on requirements for target courses.

After inputting courses and their prerequisite courses if any, students will be able to do the following:
- Create an output file where each line represents a course, and it's direct prerequisite courses.
- Check to see if a course is an indirect prerequisite of another with an output of 'YES' or 'NO'.
- See the courses a student is eligible to take with the input of courses they've already completed.
- Check courses a student needs to take with given completed courses in order to be eligible for target course.
- Create a schedule plan of future semesters based on prerequisite requirements in order to be eligible to take target course.
